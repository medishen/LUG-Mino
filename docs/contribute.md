## Semantic Commit Messages

We use **semantic commit messages** to keep history clean and meaningful. This means your commit messages should follow this structure:

```
<type>(scope): short summary
```

### Examples:

* `docs(session-01): fix typo in section title`
* `feat(session-02): add example script for user management`
* `refactor(template): clean up LaTeX spacing and comments`

### Allowed types:

| Type       | Meaning                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | New content or functionality               |
| `fix`      | Bugfix or error correction                 |
| `docs`     | Documentation or text updates              |
| `style`    | Formatting changes (no content change)     |
| `refactor` | Internal restructuring                     |
| `test`     | Add or modify examples/test cases          |
| `chore`    | Other tasks (e.g., file renaming, cleanup) |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Try to keep commits small and focused. One commit = one logical change.

## LaTeX Guidelines

* Use `UTF-8` encoding.
* Stick to standard LaTeX commands (`\section`, `\subsection`, etc.).
* Use `lmodern` or `cmr` fonts unless session needs a specific style.
* If using external packages, add them to the session's `.tex` header with clear comments.
* If you add diagrams using TikZ or similar tools, document them well.

## Review Process

All pull requests will be reviewed by the repository maintainer. The review may include:

* Suggestions for rewording or clarity
* Requests to split large changes into smaller commits
* Formatting corrections

We aim to keep the tone consistent and the quality high, especially for educational content.
