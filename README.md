# LUG-Mino

This repository hosts the materials for the MinoDasht Linux User Group (LUG), starting from the very first session.

All session-related content, including PDF documents (written in LaTeX), code examples, notes, and other resources, will be added here progressively as the group activities continue.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document and share everything covered in our local Linux User Group sessions â€” in a clear, open, and accessible format. It also serves as an archive for learning materials that others can freely use, contribute to, or adapt.

## License

All materials in this repository are open-source. See the `LICENSE` file for more details.

## Contributions

This is a personal/public project, but contributions, corrections, and suggestions are welcome. Fork, edit, or open a pull request.
