    \section{Session 1: Introduction to Linux and Open Source}\label{sec:session1}
    
    In this first meeting of the Mino LUG (Linux User Group), we covered the following topics in an informal, conversational style:
    
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item \textbf{What is a LUG?} A Linux User Group is simply a gathering of tech enthusiasts who love Linux and open‐source software. We get together to share experiences, learn from each other, and support newcomers. In our first session, there were four of us, but size doesn’t matter -- the focus is on sharing knowledge and growing together.
    	\item \textbf{Our Group’s Goal.} The aim of the Mino LUG is to create a friendly community where members can ask questions, present mini‐talks, work on collaborative projects, and help each other solve Linux‑related challenges.
    	\item \textbf{What Is Open Source?} Open source refers to software whose source code is publicly available for anyone to inspect, modify, and distribute. This approach promotes transparency, collaboration, and rapid innovation.
    	\item \textbf{Open Source Culture.} The open source culture values openness, meritocracy, and community contribution. Developers coordinate via public repositories, mailing lists, and forums, offering patches and improvements without monetary reward.
    	\item \textbf{What Is Linux?} Linux is a free, Unix‐like operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Distributions bundle the kernel with system tools and applications to provide complete operating systems.
    	\item \textbf{Who Is Linus Torvalds?} Linus Torvalds is the Finnish software engineer who initiated the Linux kernel project. His pioneering work laid the foundation for one of the world’s most widely used open‐source projects.
    	\item \textbf{Why People Prefer Open Source.} Many choose open source for the freedom to inspect code, customize features, avoid vendor lock‑in, and benefit from community‐driven support.
    	\item \textbf{Why Contribute Without Pay?} Contributors are often motivated by personal learning, reputation building, the desire to solve real‑world problems, and the joy of collaborating with like‑minded peers.
    	\item \textbf{Benefits of Open Source.} Advantages include cost savings, security through transparency, faster bug fixes, and a vast ecosystem of shared tools and libraries.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \paragraph{Repository and Future Notes} For convenience, I have decided to publish all session notes and logs in our GitHub repository. You can find it here:
    
    \begin{center}
        \url{https://github.com/medishen/LUG-Mino}
    \end{center}
    
    From now on, every topic discussed in our meetings will be added as a PDF (and in LaTeX source) in English to this repository. That way, anyone who misses a session can catch up on what was covered. Everyone who participated in a session can contribute by editing, adding, or even removing items to keep our notes complete and up to date.
